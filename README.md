# Exploring-the-History-of-Lego

### Project Description
The Rebrickable database includes data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, you will get to explore the Rebrickable database and answer a series of questions related to the history of Lego!
